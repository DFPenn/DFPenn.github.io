Hi, welcome to my personal website! I am PhD student in statistics at RUC. I‚Äôm passionate about biostatistics and hope to continue my research and studies in this field.

During my research program, I have worked on several projects involving the application of statistical models in medicine. These include developing risk prediction models for cancer patients, evaluating the predictive performance of new factors in risk prediction models, and updating model performance. I have also explored non-parametric estimation of risk prediction models when dealing with expensive, new predictors that have missing data (two-phase data), sampling design for two-phase studies, and evaluating model performance with imbalanced data.

I am also eager to continue learning about machine learning for healthcare. I‚Äôve previously applied machine learning models to medical data mining, which I found incredibly fascinating, and I‚Äôm keen to delve deeper into this area.

This is the introduction of a "newbie researcher". BTW...My website is quite simple at the moment! I hope to gradually improve and enrich it over time. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

# üî¨ Research Experience 
- **2023.07 - 2023.09**, *Well-calibrated risk prediction model of binary outcomes with missing data*  
  - Assisted in establishing predictive models, addressing discordance between "target" and "data source" populations in breast cancer risk models by proposing a constrained calibration model using two-phase data.
  - Performed numerical simulations to gauge the model‚Äôs robustness with varied distributions in two-phase data, exploring diverse scenarios to validate its robustness.

- **2023.09 - 2023.11**, *Textual Data Refinement and Patient Profiling in Electronic Health Records*  
  - Utilized NLP algorithms to systematically classify and organize electronic health records, and extracted relevant medical indicators, creating a streamlined and organized representation of patient information.

- **2023.12 - 2024.03**, *Two-phase sampling and analysis for predicting binary outcomes*  
  - Utilized a semiparametric model to estimate the predicted risk and the AUC under the two-phase data. The model evaluation was conducted through simulations based on various two-stage sampling methods, including case-control, simple random sampling, balanced sampling, and R-balanced sampling.

- **2023.09 - 2023.10**, *Clinical Intelligent Diagnostic Modeling for Hemorrhagic Stroke*  
  - Processed Big Data in Electronic Health Records using machine learning, applied the Boruta algorithm to identify significant predictors for hematoma expansion, and utilized the XGBoost regression model to forecast 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores based on comprehensive feature sets.
